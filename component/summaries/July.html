            <h2 class="first_word">Alice </h2>
            <p style="display: inline;" class="lead">and John decided to spend the summer in Chatham. However, during
                one of Alice's
                walks along the beach, <span class="text-success">she felt drawn to the warm seawater and found herself
                    walking into the sea. At
                    that moment, thoughts of suicide briefly crossed her mind as she contemplated drifting away until
                    she
                    could no longer swim.</span>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p class="lead">Hopefully, John returned just in time. Instead of scolding her, he joined her in the water,
            providing comfort
            and support.</p>
        <p class="lead">Unfortunately, Alice's condition continued to deteriorate. She became confused, unable to
            remember her
            intended actions. <span class="text-success">As she tried to recall the need to use the restroom, she
                couldn't find it, and the
                distressing moment of incontinence was witnessed by John, which left Alice feeling utterly
                devastated.</span></p>
        <p class="lead">While John attended the International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease, he tried to gather
            information to
            help Alice in his own way. However, Alice remained skeptical and doubted that he would find anything
            meaningful.</p>
        <p class="lead"><span class="text-success">Alice had forgotten about her sister Anne's passing. When Lydia and
                John repeatedly telled her,
                Alice
                couldn't comprehend the reality and believed that Anne had only recently died, feeling left out of the
                loop.</span>
            This lack of communication left Alice distrusting John.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p id="quote">What do you think Alice walked into the water?</p>
        <p class="text-muted">I think that when Alice first walked into the sea, she would experience a sense of
            happiness and acceptance.
            She
            would discover that the water is pleasantly warm, and she might even wish to stay in the sea indefinitely.
            As Alice's condition has progressed, she has lost many abilities in her daily life. She was aware of this
            herself, and she realized that it is becoming increasingly difficult for her to interact with people she
            used to be close to. For example, John no longer asked her for help(find his glasses). It felt as if her
            illness had caused her to lose the Alice she once was. This realization added a touch of melancholy to her
            life, and she struggled to face how to continue living. Therefore, I believe Alice would want to stay in the
            sea because only the ocean can provide her with direct warmth and acceptance.</p>
        <p class="text-muted">I have had my own experiences
            of walking into the water at the beach, and I believe the ocean possesses a certain magic. It is warm enough
            and the waves continuously caress every part of the body, allowing a person to relax or temporarily forget
            about the troubles of reality. It makes one want to keep walking towards the depths of the sea.</p>
