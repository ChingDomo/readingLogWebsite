            <h2 class="first_word">As </h2>
            <p style="display: inline;" class="lead">Alice read her students' evaluations alongside Eric, <span
                    class="text-success">she finally
                    confronted the harsh reality that her Alzheimer's disease had long been impacting her daily
                    performance.</span> It was a sobering realization, and she had to come to terms with the fact that
                <span class="text-success">she could no longer continue her beloved role as a teacher.</span> With a mix
                of sadness and
                acceptance, she composed a letter to inform all her classmates and colleagues, gracefully
                bidding farewell to Harvard.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p class="lead">However, accepting her altered circumstances and the loss of her valued position proved to be an
            arduous process for Alice. She struggled to come to grips with the sense of worth that had been
            stripped away. Despite this, she chose to stay involved in the academic realm by attending
            conferences and offering guidance to her students.</p>
        <p class="lead">During one such conference, though, Alice noticed a marked shift in the dynamics of her
            relationships. <span class="text-success">Those whom she had once considered as family in the academic
                community seemed to
                shy away, avoiding her company.</span> It became apparent that her condition made her colleagues
            uncomfortable, leading to a sense of isolation.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">Furthermore, at the conference, Alice's cognitive decline manifested in her repetitive speech
            patterns. While she managed to identify pertinent issues and ask insightful questions, she
            unwittingly found herself stuck in a loop, <span class="text-success">repeating the same words over and over
                again. This
                repetition not only frustrated Alice but also caused embarrassment among those in attendance.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="lead">This experience served as a poignant reminder of the profound impact Alzheimer's had on Alice's
            once vibrant and engaging presence. It was a painful realization that even in the professional
            spaces she had thrived in, her disease had become a prominent and inhibiting force, resulting in
            strained relationships and hindering her ability to participate fully.</p>
