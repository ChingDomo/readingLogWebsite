            <h2 class="first_word">Realizing </h2>
            <p style="display: inline;" class="lead"> that her condition would impose other hardships on her family,
                except the
                genetic risk, <span class="text-success">Alice explored the option of a nursing center, examining the
                    facilities and services
                    available there.</span> However, she discovered that specialized Alzheimer's care facilities were
                prohibitively
                expensive and patients there had no conversation and no socializing, the only voice was someone singing
                the same old song all the time. <span class="text-success">The cost and the state of paitents made her
                    feel terriable, she could
                    not image that one day she would become like that way.</span>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p class="lead">Feeling discouraged, Alice was determined to devise a new plan. Thinking about her mother's
            words about
            butterflies having a short but beautiful life, which empathize herself, she decided to do something she had
            never tried before her diagnosis, like enjoying an ice cream cone. Additionally, <span
                class="text-success">she crafted a plan she
                named "Butterfly," which involved contemplating suicide. She stored "Butterfly" on her computer and set
                daily reminders on her BlackBerry, which prompted her to answer personal verification questions.</span>
            Alice
            believed that implementing this plan would alleviate John's financial burden of caring for a woman who could
            no longer recognize him, and whom he could no longer recognize in return.</p>
        <p class="lead">Despite the severity of Alice's cognitive decline, she seemed unaware of the extent to which her
            condition
            had deteriorated. She <span class="text-success">started adding tasks to her to-do list that were more
                appropriate for her student
                years. Worser, In one of Alice's classes, instead of taking her usual place at the podium, she opted a
                seat
                for students.</span> Failing to recognize that she was the professor and not a student in that moment,
            Alice made
            the decision to leave after only twenty minutes, which was due to a formal rule at Harvard.</p>
        <p class="lead">This alarming progression of Alice's behavior and thought patterns highlighted the urgency and
            severity of
            her condition. Her distorted perception of reality and her increasing detachment from her former self were
            clear signs of the devastating impact of Alzheimer's disease on her life.</p>
