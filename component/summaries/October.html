                    class="text-success">her remarkable
                    memory shone
                    through as she effortlessly
                    recalled the exact reference</span>, outshining even her fellow professors. However, there was a
                puzzling
                moment
                when she couldn't remember the significance of "Eric" on her to-do list, prompting her to take action
                and
                contact her doctor for further evaluation.

        <p class="lead">October arrived, and it marked Alice's birthday. Her family, John, Anna and Tom, gathered for a
            celebratory
            meal, albeit with Lydia's absence. While taking a moment for herself in the restroom, Alice noticed blood in
            the toilet, <span class="text-success">indicating that her symptoms were not simply attributed to
                menopause.</span> This discovery heightened
            her apprehension and spurred her determination to seek medical attention.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <p id="quote">The scene that Alice was in the ladyâ€™s room is an important one. What did she do there? By reading
            these paragraphs, can you understand why she cried hard?</p>
        <p class="text-muted">Alice attributed her increasing forgetfulness and disorientation to menopause. However, in
            the scene in the
            women's restroom, she discovered that she was still menstruating (p.41). This indicated that there were
            other underlying issues in her body that were causing her various symptoms. This realization shattered her
            initial relief, and she found herself confronted with an unknown illness, leading her to break down in
            tears. At this point, I can empathize with her, as no one can gracefully and calmly face the reality of
            getting disease.
        </p>
        <p id="quote">What can you tell about the relationship between Anna and Lydia? Do you think Alice is aware of
            the
            sibling rivalry between her two daughters?</p>
        <p class="text-muted">Anna and Lydia have a competitive relationship regarding who is the smartest and most
            successful daughter in
            the Howland family (p.38). Anna has always been deeply concerned about this and fears that she may not
            measure up to Lydia. The reality consistently shows that Anna needs to put in effort to achieve the results
            that Lydia effortlessly attains. Therefore, Anna feels a sense of happiness when Lydia decides not to attend
            college because it doesn't threaten her position. </p>
        <p class="text-muted">I believe Alice is aware of this situation. My reasoning is that when responding to Anna's
            question, Alice
            casually describes Lydia's situation by saying, "She is good." This indicates that Alice doesn't fully agree
            with Lydia's abilities but doesn't want to fuel Anna's comparisons or diminish her siblings, so she chooses
            to provide a subtle description.</p>
