    <div class="container px-4 px-lg-5">
        <p> Still Alice marked a significant milestone for me as it was <span class="text-success">the first English
                novel I successfully
                completed</span>,
            and its timing felt serendipitous. On one hand, I had developed a fear of English classes during the
            previous semester, leading to a deep dislike for the language. However, this novel served as a comforting
            medium that <span class="text-success">gradually helped me integrate English into my life</span> and foster
            a genuine appreciation for it.
            Moreover, through Alice's experiences, I found myself empathizing with situations that were previously
            foreign to me. This indirect <span class="text-success">influence permeated my real life</span>, shaping my
            personal perspective on life and
            death and impacting my interactions with my family. Reading Still Alice <span class="text-success">provided
                me with a sense of relief.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike many other English novels, Still Alice avoids complex language and instead presents a relatable
            narrative free from excessive technical vocabulary. This played a role in enabling me to finish the book.
            Additionally, my expanding vocabulary reached a level where I no longer needed to constantly consult a
            dictionary with every page, allowing me to immerse myself fully in the story.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, delving into Still Alice <span class="text-success">didn't posed a challenge to reading for me, but my
                mindset.</span> While empathizing
            with the characters, particularly Alice, my thoughts often veered towards my own life. Alice is a character
            I find it difficult to wholeheartedly like, <span class="text-success">yet her traits resonate with a blend
                of myself and my mother,
                creating an intricate emotional connection.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Speaking of my mother, the argument between Alice and Lydia regarding college choices struck a chord within
            me, vividly reminding me of my final year of high school. During that time, daily debates about selecting a
            major became the norm. In those three months, I slept for less than two hours per day, allocating the rest
            of the night to emotional struggles. Ultimately, both my mother and I sought assistance from a psychological
            clinic. At the age of 17, I considered my mother an unreasonable tyrant and even forcefully altered my
            preferences on college applications. However, while reading Still Alice, <span class="text-success">I gained
                access to Alice's thoughts
                through the omniscient perspective. As I contemplated her innermost musings, it felt as if I was
                glimpsing
                into my own mother's mind.</span> I came to understand that her decisions stemmed from anxiety, driven
            by the
            desire for me to embark on the right path without any regrets, as the doors of life were just opening. This
            realization had a profound impact on me and aided in my journey of letting go.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, I see reflections of myself in Alice, particularly in her sense of pride. I have long
            been aware of my elevated self-esteem, taking pride in my achievements, upbringing in the capital, and
            various abilities. However, the stark contrast between Alice's Alzheimer's disease and her impressive memory
            engenders a profound irony within me, which also invokes a sense of helplessness, <span
                class="text-success">reinforcing the belief
                that
                those abilities were bestowed upon me by fate, and if they can be given, they can be taken away.</span>
            I
            deeply
            empathize with Alice's struggle to maintain her quality, and it is always distressing to contemplate that
            one day, I too will age, fall ill, or encounter unforeseen accidents, causing these sources of pride to slip
            away while I remain utterly powerless.
        </p>
        <p>

            Besides Alice's qualities, the impact of "Still Alice" on my mindset was amplified by its timing in my life
            when my grandmother, father, and aunt were all battling illnesses. <span class="text-success">While reading
                the book, my thoughts were
                incessantly influenced by the harsh realities of my own experiences. However, paradoxically, it also
                provided me with solace.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Influenced by my family's struggles, I couldn't avoid confronting the fragility of life and the
            inevitability of death. The notion of Alice's Butterfly Plan resonated deeply with me—I embraced the idea
            that life may be fleeting, but it should always be embraced with elegance. <span
                class="text-success">Nonetheless, whether it was
                Alice, my other family members, or my grandmother who also suffered from Alzheimer's, none of them could
                ultimately navigate their circumstances with grace.</span> This profound sense of
            helplessness I encountered throughout the book was suffocating, yet it crystallized my understanding that
            this is the inescapable reality I confront each day. This realization paradoxically empowered me to confront
            and accept reality, <span class="text-success"> through my connection with the book's world, I recognized
                that life is inherently
                intertwined with helplessness and no longer feared it as acutely</span>.
        </p>
        <p> Hence, I would assert that "Still Alice" not only challenged me but also provided a respite—a relief fromthe
            burdens I carried. <span class="text-success">It is not a novel that helps people to escape from the
                harshness of reality.On the
                contrary, it embodies a striking realism.</span> The act of reading compelled me to reflect upon my own
            family's
            experiences, which also facilitated a profound empathic connection with my mother and the universal sense of
            human helplessness. <span class="text-success">While I experienced Alice's struggles and helplessness, I
                gained insight into the
                understanding that there are others in the world who can genuinely empathize with my own journey. This
                realization brought me immense relief.</span>
        </p>
        <p> In conclusion, <span class="text-success">my initial motivation for reading "Still Alice" stemmed from my
                desire to select an English
                class that piqued my interest</span>. However, as I immersed myself in the narrative, I discovered that
            language
            merely served as a conduit, while the true essence lay in empathy. Although the specific details of "Still
            Alice" may fade from my memory by this time next year, the enduring recollection will be the profound
            experience of empathy it evoked within me. <span class="text-success">At some juncture, the narrative of
                Alice's life intertwined with
                my own, and in experiencing her helplessness, I simultaneously processed and alleviated my own
                pain.</span></p>
