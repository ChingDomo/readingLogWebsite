                    Europe</span>. The traditional tarot deck consists of 78
                cards, divided into two main sections: the Major Arcana and the Minor Arcana.</p>
            <p class="lead">The Major Arcana consists of 22 cards, each representing <span
                    style="color: rgb(1, 150, 108)">significant life events, archetypal
                    figures, and universal themes</span>. These cards symbolize powerful forces and transformative
                experiences that
                shape a person's journey.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">The Minor Arcana comprises 56 cards, divided into four suits: Wands, Cups, Swords, and
                Pentacles. Each suit corresponds to a specific element and represents <span
                    style="color: rgb(1, 150, 108)">different aspects of daily life,

                concerns to provide insights and guidance.

            <h2>Pretzel</h2>
            <p class="lead">A pretzel is a type of baked bread product that is <span
                    style="color: rgb(1, 150, 108)">twisted into a knot-like shape </span>and often
                sprinkled with coarse salt. The origins of the pretzel can be traced back to Europe, particularly
                Germany, where it has a long history dating back to the Middle Ages.</p>
            <p class="lead">Traditionally, pretzels are made from a simple dough consisting of flour, water, yeast, and
                salt. The dough is shaped into the distinctive knot shape and then <span
                    style="color: rgb(1, 150, 108)">briefly boiled in water before being
                    baked</span>. This process gives pretzels their characteristic chewy texture and golden-brown crust.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">In addition to the classic salted pretzel, there are numerous flavor variations available,
                such as pretzels topped with sesame seeds, cheese, cinnamon-sugar, or dipped in chocolate. Pretzels are
                enjoyed <span style="color: rgb(1, 150, 108)">both on their own as a snack and as a versatile ingredient
                    in various recipes</span>, including
                sandwiches, pretzel buns, and pretzel-based desserts.</p>
            <!-- <p class="lead">Today, pretzels are enjoyed worldwide and have become a popular and recognizable symbol of
                    traditional baked goods. Whether enjoyed as a quick snack or incorporated into culinary creations,
