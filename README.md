# readingLogWebsite

This is a website for a reading log of still Alice, created using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It can serve as a template for building static web pages.

Each page within the reading log has its own instructions for usage. In this reading log:
(1) Book information can be directly read.
(2) Reflections can be directly read.
(3) The Summary page provides a timeline-like overview with event-oriented descriptions. Clicking on "View Details" will display paragraph-style summaries. There are a total of 13 chapter summaries and 5 discussions. Chapters marked with " â¦¿ " indicate that discussions are available when clicking "View Details."
(4) In the Glossary page, the "Vocabulary" and "Expression" sections can be clicked to jump to the corresponding positions for easier reading.
(5) In the Quotes page, clicking on each quote card will flip it, revealing my personal reflections on the back.
(6) The Culture Notes page is a single-page display and can be directly viewed.
(7) Pages with a "Reference" button can be clicked to access the web pages I used as references.
