Each page within the reading log has its own instructions for usage. In this reading log:<br>
(1) Book information can be directly read.<br>
(2) Reflections can be directly read.<br>
(3) The Summary page provides a timeline-like overview with event-oriented descriptions. Clicking on "View Details" will display paragraph-style summaries. There are a total of 13 chapter summaries and 5 discussions. Chapters marked with " â¦¿ " indicate that discussions are available when clicking "View Details."<br>
(4) In the Glossary page, the "Vocabulary" and "Expression" sections can be clicked to jump to the corresponding positions for easier reading.<br>
(5) In the Quotes page, clicking on each quote card will flip it, revealing my personal reflections on the back.<br>
(6) The Culture Notes page is a single-page display and can be directly viewed.<br>
(7) Pages with a "Reference" button can be clicked to access the web pages I used as references.<br>
